- Debug render text.
- Editor and level format.
- Debug ui and visuals.
- Command prompt.
- Tweak file.
- Change the textures to sprites(?) in the asset system.
- Some kind of zoom.
- Animations.
- Have player face correct direction.
- Jump cooldown.
- Enforce max rope length
	- Set the rope length to exactly max length when we go over.
	- Make the rope length respond to changes in player's position.
- Slide vs vault when displacement is small?
- Different representation of Rectangle for certain parts of the program.
	- A lot of recalculations for upper-left, upper-right, lower-left corners.
	- Might be worse for general colliders b/c of cache. For players?
- Jump press timing wiggle room.
	- Jump some time after running off ledge still registers as a jump even though no grounded.
	- Jump some time before landing still does a jump when landed.
- Cleanup debug stuff.
- Animate the ledge grab.
	- Have the player interpolate to the ledge grab position.
	- Some kind of grabbing animation for the movement?

+ Camera that follows player.
+ Pull in / let out rope while attached.
+ Nice camera that moves smoothly.
+ Change debug to use meters instead of pixels.
+ Change textures to scale properly with window size.
+ Better movement:
	+ Some kind of acceleration/decceleration when moving/stopping.
+ Grab ledges.
+ Handle alpha correctly.
+ Fix the rope start position.

Ideas:
- Grapple to the floor, run, then fling.
- Jump and then turn around and grapple to something.
- Controlling bounce by letting out/in more line.
- Add dash and chain them together.
- Timed area - have to push a switch and make it through a door before it closes.
- Dash, slide, wall jump?
- Area where walls cause death.
- Low gravity, switched gravity direction.
- Speed from rope / dash persists during run until player stops.
- Pushing buttons down.
- Barrier that your hook can't go through.
- Running in against the rope and then releasing to fling.
- Lava. Jump too long, but can't grapple to destination corner b/c of lava, so forced to fling.
- Vertical scaling.
- Forced to hook backwards due to double spikes.
